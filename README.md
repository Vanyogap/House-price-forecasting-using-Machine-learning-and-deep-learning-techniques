# House-price-forecasting-using-Machine-learning-and-deep-learning-techniques
This project aims to predict the house prices with the input of conventional housing attributes. Various regressionalgorithms both simple and advanced such as Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Gradient Boost, Random Forest,XGBoost are trained on the provided house price dataset to predict the house prices with the input of differentfactors that a buyer considers while purchasing a house. RMSE approach is used to calculate the errors andaccuracy of prediction is calculated in each case to find the best model that fits the given data.
